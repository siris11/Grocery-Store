The problem statement for this project was to develop a web application, ‘Grocery Store’. It is a multi-user
app (one required admin/store manager and other users) enabling a user to login/signup with the
application and order grocery items for purchase. User can also see his previous orders. Admin/Store
manager can perform CRUD operations on the category and products thus managing the grocery store.
